## Bash Scripts

These are various snippets of bash code. They aren't really complete scripts - they just demonstrate techniques that I use with some frequency. They're tiny bits of code, but they often have some bit of obscure syntax or fiddly edge cases that are easy to forget.

Right now, they're completely unusable. I'm in the middle of trying out a bunch of ideas, and everything is half-done.
